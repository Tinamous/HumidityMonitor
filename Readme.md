Comprises of:

1) Outer box (19L XL Really Useful Box).
2) Laser cut acrylic silica gel case
3) Particle Photon based humidity sensing and fan control PCB inside silica gel case.
4) Self indicating silica gel inside #2.

#1 Outer box
---------------------
A 19L XL A4 suspension folder Really Useful Box works well. Be sure to get the one with the high lid. (not the regular 19L box).

* Needed: Staples link to case.
* Maplin: http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/really-useful-19l-xl-box-n68fl (Untested but it's a lot cheaper than the staples one!)

The lid of the 19L XL case will need to be drilled to hold the acrylic silica gel cartridge in place. Do this before gluing the cartridge so the acrylic can be used as a template.

Place what is labeled as the top piece in the designs (actually the bottom piece with all the holes in it) onto the lid and mark/drill the 4 corner screws.

If you wish for the power to go in via the top (prevents boxes being stacked but is obvious that it is powered so prevents people missing it) use the large bottom piece (actually top) with the larger round hole in it and align the two corner screws then drill out the larger hole in the lid.

Power connectors were sourced from eBay (http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/PLUGZ2GO-2-1MM-X-5-5MM-PANEL-MOUNT-DC-PLUG-SOCKET-JACK-CHOICE-OF-COLOUR-/221456273750?var=&hash=item338fd29156:m:m85llLg3q2OnjM6yf-dwyPw), be sure you can get the same before drilling the power connector hole in the lid. 

Alternativly power connection may be done from the side of the lid by running the power cable out of either top or bottom gel case holes, this would allow the boxes to be stacked, although it makes it less obvious theirs a cable connected so care needs to be taken.

#2 Laser Cut Acrylic Gel Case
-----------------------------
5mm clear acrylic cut as detailed in Hardware\Case\LaserCut

(You can use another colour obviously but the clear is cheaper and allows the self indicating gel to be seen).

The case contains a 40mm fan. A standard 3 pin PC fan should be used with a filter to prevent silica gel getting in to it.


#3 Humidity Monitor.
---------------------

Use Particle Photon (or can use Particle Core device).

See Hardware\PCB\V2

Ignore buzzer on V2 (actually 0.2) PCB as this is non-functional at this time.

Don't use V1 as the FET has Source/Drain the wrong way around.

PCB available from OSHPark: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/nOVDuNCE

JP3 or JP4 are used for the HTU21 sensor. SparkFun and eBay boards have swapped SDA/SCL, watch for correct version.
* JP3 is for the eBay version
* JP4 is for SparkFun version.

Build using build.particle.io, see source folder.

A 12V power supply us needed capable of supplying upto 500mA (depends on the fan).

If a 5V fan is used a 5V PSU can be used and the onboard regulator not fitted, instead connecting the Vin to VOut holes with a piece of wire.


#4 Self indicating silica gel
-----------------------------
Almost any silica gel can be used and doesn't need to be self indicating but it helps with seeing when the gel needs to be dried and when drying the gel that it is ready.

Gel should be stored in a sealed box/bag when not in use.

Gel can be re-generated by heating in an electric (untested on gas) oven for about 3 hours at 110°C

#5 Connection to Tinamous
-------------------------
Optional step. Tinamous supports Particle devices by use of the ParticleBot in Tinamous and will automatically bring in and store devices/measurements so the humidity can be remotely monitored.
