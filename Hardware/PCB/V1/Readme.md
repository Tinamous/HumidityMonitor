Version 1 Design.

Note that the Q1 has Source and Drain pins the wrong way around. When fitting Q1 rotate it 180 degrees and shift right so that the gate pin is not over a hole and on the right hand side.

Connect a wire between gate and the left most hole for Q1 (from above with the photon on the right). remaining 2 pins go into the remaining holes.
